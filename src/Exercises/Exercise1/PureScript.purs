--    data Maybe a  -- `Maybe`: Name of type
--      = Nothing   -- `Nothing`: Constructor for when we donâ€™t have a value
--      | Just a    -- `Just`: Constructor for when we do have a value.
--                     The `a` in `Just a` refers to the `a` in `Maybe a`.
--                     It stands for a type, e.g., `Int`, `String`, etc.
--                     This will let you describe different kinds of `Maybe`
--                     without having to write new code, e.g. `Maybe Int`,
--                     `Maybe String`, etc.
